# Breast Cancer Classification - ML Prediction
The goal is to predict whether someone has breast cancer or not.  
** Demonstrate a typical workflow for analyzing a dataset, training a machine learning model, evaluating its performance, and making predictions on new data for a binary classification task related to breast cancer detection.

## Project Overview

## Dataset

## Machine Learning Prediction
### Install dependencies
sets up the necessary imports and initial steps for a machine learning workflow.

### Data collection and processing
- Load the breast cancer dataset, convert it into a pandas DataFrame.
- Add a target column for class labels (benign or malignant).
- Inspect the DataFrame by displaying its shape, summary statistics, and checking for missing values.
- Analyze the distribution of the target variable,
- Group the data by label to calculate mean feature values
- Rename columns for better clarity.
